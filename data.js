      'Simon Heath was my sponsor as part of the Elevate UK Leadership Program in 2022, which is a leadership program for Black women across WPP and various agencies such as MediaCom, Group M, and Ogilvy. It was a great experience! At first, I was apprehensive, as I felt there were too many differences between us, and I questioned whether he would be able to understand my experience as a Black woman in the workplace. However, Simon was an ally; he was open, transparent, and came from a place of learning. I would wholeheartedly recommend Simon for any coaching and/or mentoring.',

    'When I reached the first senior leadership position of my career, I asked my CEO for a coach to help me succeed. Simon was our CPO at the time, but I was lucky enough to be coached directly by him. Four years and two roles later, every session is still as valuable to me. Simon helped me understand how to focus on my strengths to grow, but also helped me align with the overall company needs through his CPO view. Very few coaches understand us as people and understand our business context the way Simon does.',
